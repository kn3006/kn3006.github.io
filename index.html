                    The most daunting task for any business leader today is “How to succeed”. Economic uncertainty, market consolidation and the need for growth through innovation have rendered the best of organizations to survival pressures and made it imperative for leaders to manage through multifaceted business challenges. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Dealing with the pressures of leading in the 21st century has its own set of challenges. Leaders now must manage performance in an intensely turbulent and complex, global business environment — one that constantly places new demands on their organizations and the capabilities of the workforce. Increasing competition, market scrutiny and employee expectations now require that leaders not only deliver business results, but that they do so in an inherently authentic, transparent and inclusive manner.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By any measures it’s a tall order for even the highest-performing executives. This then brings us to a point where we need to address the following burning questions:
                    <ul style="text-align: justify;; list-style: inside;">
                      <li>What kind of leadership will be effective in steering organizations to success through such economic volatility and chaos?</li>
                      <li>What are the emerging skills required for such leadership?</li>
                      <li>How can one build and sustain an effective leadership strategy?</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Extreme Leadership: The New Imperative </b><br>
                    Extreme leadership is a refreshing and practical approach for today’s extreme challenges that acknowledges the complexity and fluid nature of business change. It is profoundly thoughtful and a useful approach to managing today’s chaotic environment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Extreme leadership workshop is about a new way to understand leadership given the managerial challenges that the world is throwing at us today.  Traditional leadership methodologies and practices may only help a little to gain a futile control over chaos, but this training program provides proven approaches for managing the challenges of today.

                    Entrepreneurial leadership stems from the notion of a leader acting as being self-employed. It involves instilling the confidence to think, behave and act with an entrepreneurial mindset in the best interests and intended purpose of the organization. An entrepreneurial leader takes on himself the responsibility to create such conditions that instead of being under control the organization generates its own order and responds creatively to the environment.  
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Surviving in the 21st century entails continuous learning and changing, a very strong characteristic of entrepreneurism.  Focusing on the important and taking leadership decisions to manage the business will be the key management function.  Unfortunately, in mature companies, more and more employees are overlooking company survival and customers as their objectives and focus on their own personal gain. Such drifting focus just results in poor decisions, less job satisfaction and eluding professional success.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Entrepreneurial Leadership is a workshop exclusively designed to help discover the core strengths of entrepreneurs, their ability to spot gaps, filling them and in the process contributing to society and economy, their behaviors related to strategy and leadership, and learning to apply the entrepreneurial mindset for achieving sustainable competitive advantage and lasting success in an organizational setting.

                    There’s a well-known Indian parable about six blind men who argue at length about what an elephant feels like. Each has a different idea, and each holds fast to his own view. “It’s like a rope,” says the man who touched the tail. “Oh no, it’s more like the solid branch of a tree,” contends the one who touched the trunk. And so on and so forth, and round and round they go.

                    The moral of the story: We all tend to overestimate how much we know — which, in turn, means that we often cling stubbornly to our beliefs while tuning out opinions different from our own. And in a time when it seems like we’re all more convinced than ever of our own rightness, social scientists have begun to look more closely at an antidote: a concept called <b>Intellectual Humility.</b>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Intellectual humility is the ability of a person who has an accurate assessment of both, his strengths and weaknesses, and views all this in the context of a larger whole and is grounded and liberated by this knowledge. Knowing his abilities, he asks how he can contribute and recognizing his deficiencies he asks how he can grow?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Research indicates that intellectually humble people are more pro-social, build connections, helpful, tolerant, sensitive and open to accepting differences. They have also been seen to behave more ethically and are honest during negotiations. Google’s VP in charge of hiring, Laszlo Bock, has claimed it as one of the top qualities he looks for in a candidate: Without intellectual humility, he has said, “you are unable to learn.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Leadership and Intellectual Humility</b> is an high impact specially designed workshop that helps develop a state of openness to new ideas, a willingness to be receptive to new sources of evidence, develop superior learners and improve the ability to engage in civil discourse.

                    Entrepreneurial mindset is a set of attitudes, skills and behaviours that are needed to succeed academically, personally and professionally. It is a comprehensive thought process that draws upon the entrepreneurial traits of identifying and acting on opportunities, pursuing innovation and creating new value.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What is the uncommon thing that is common in people like Bill Gates, Richard Branson, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk and Steve Jobs who are said to have put a dent in the universe. “An entrepreneurial mindset”! A World Bank joint study with Singapore University Business School, released on 22-Sept 2017 reveals the following startling facts; Traditional business training focusing on accounting, marketing and other basic skills are widely used globally, but are showing limited impact and therefore it is important to find a better alternative that embodies innovation, identifying and adopting new opportunities, risk taking and self-fulfillment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Entrepreneurial mindset is a highly transforming training program exclusively designed to explore the thought process of successful entrepreneurs, examining the world through their eyes, understanding how they think, how they recognize opportunities, and the mindset that enabled them to transform those opportunities into successful new ventures.

                    Today, 88% of the Fortune 500 companies that existed in 1955 are unrecognizable forgotten companies. Panam, Polaroid, Kodak, Toys R Us are just a few hallowed names that have bitten the dust. Obviously, neither size nor reputation guarantees continued success or survival.

                    Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is the single most important indicator in producing people who can work effectively in organizations at the highest levels. Long term sustainability requires that people go beyond IQ and develop their full EQ.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    According to a recent research of over two million employees at 700 companies done by Gallup, findings revealed that employees who had managers with high EQ were four times less likely to leave than those who had managers with low EQ. Further, teams engaged by high EQ leaders showed higher customer rating, greater profitability, higher productivity, fewer accidents and less absenteeism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Emotional intelligence is the key to professional success and leaders with a high level of emotional intelligence are able to take their leadership from mediocre to an outstanding level.

                  <p>
                    Assertive communication is effective communication, it’s how to deal with success and confidence with people around you. Assertive people feel in control and achieve win-win outcomes in any interpersonal situation. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One spends a significant portion of his working hours communicating in one way or another. Studies conducted by Mckinsey Global Institute reveal that on an average, leaders spent about 80% of their workdays in communicating. On the lowest side, the average time spent by an individual in communicating is 20 hrs. in a 6-day week.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If one was to quantify time spent in communicating in terms of cost of manhours per individual annually, it would range from Rs. 90,000/- at the lowest level to Rs. 40,00,000/- for a leader. As a company grows and increases, so does the expenses. The role of communication in reputation and relationship building is critical and there is a direct connection between effectiveness of communication and company’s bottom line.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    So, if communication is a primary activity vital for success in the work place how can one ensure it is being done right.

                    Rational thought is an analysis that can be described by a kind of an algorithm followed by computers. Flexible thought cannot. As humans we have evolved the capacity of flexible thinking in order to help us face the challenges of everyday life and  help us succeed when circumstances change – which is why it is increasingly important to hone these skills today.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Cognitive flexibility can be broadly defined as the ability to shift one’s thinking from old situations to new situations as well as the ability to overcome responses or thinking that have become habitual and adapt to the new situation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In simple terms, cognitive flexibility is the ability to shift the course of thoughts or actions according to the changing demand of the situation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Change is inevitable and each one of us has to undergo change at some point in life. Many a times change is perceived as a pain for the simple reason of all the work it may entail. People don’t like change if it harms them, creates undue risk, or causes them to put it extra effort. On the other hand, no one likes repetitive jobs, or watching the same episode on television every night. We humans are designed to prefer little variety if it comes at no extra cost.

                    The essence of the fourth industrial revolution is about connecting physical work to the internet. From a machine in a factory to a toothbrush at home, everything will be equipped with sensors and share data via internet connections.

                  <p>
                    On one side this development will bring out a lot of new features, added value and efficiency improvements, and on the other it will result in the growth of complexities making problem solving more difficult in the coming times.

                  <p>
                    <b>Complex Problem Solving</b> is defined as the capacity needed to solve new, poorly defined problems in complex situations. Day by day our business environment is becoming more complex and at an increasing rate of change. Organizations need effective problem solvers and are indicating us that our business schools and academics are failing to meet this need. Complex problem-solving training therefore is vital and critical for most of us as problem solving does not come naturally to us.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Future success of the organizations will be determined by the ability of executives to better understand and take advantage of complexity and challenges that cannot be solved by existing problem solving strategies. Technology is unlikely to remedy the situation anytime soon, on the contrary, the rise of artificial intelligence and other new technologies are likely to place an even bigger premium on human problem solving.

                    Organisations nowadays have to keep themselves afloat with the ever-changing pace of the business world. The shifting movement is going towards a more <b>collaborating, innovating and team-based</b> way of operating. As a result, top leaders need to take a more open approach in the workplace in which each and every member of the team engages and contributes to the overall success.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Collaboration is beneficial to not only the company but also to the employees. <b>Working collaboratively</b> creates an inclusive environment, allows individuals to be more creative, daring and striving towards excellence.

                  <p>
                    Collaborative leadership is basically the <b>enhanced relationship</b> between managers and employees. They cooperate to accomplish a shared goal. Leaders must be able to work with people from other teams, branches or from another department to make sure the workflows and ideas are aligned without any confusion.
                  </p>

                    Everyone thinks; it is human nature to do so. However, much of human thinking if left to itself, is biased, distorted, partial, uninformed or down-right prejudiced. But still the quality of our life and that of what we produce, make, or build, depends precisely on the quality of our thoughts. It therefore follows that shoddy thinking is costly, at times fatal, both in money and in quality of life.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This calls for systematically cultivating excellence in thoughts. <b>Critical Thinking</b> is that mode of thinking – about any subject, content, or problem – in which the thinker improves the quality of his thinking by skillfully taking charge of the structures inherent in thinking and imposing intellectual standards upon them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Critical thinking</b> is a self-guided, self-disciplined thinking that attempts to reason at the highest level of quality in a fair-minded way.  It refers to the ability to analyze information objectively and make a reasoned and informed judgement, and is therefore one of the most sought-after skills in every industry and every workplace.
